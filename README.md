# E-Commerce Customer Analysis

This project simulates realistic e-commerce data and focuses on analyzing customer behavior using key metrics. The analysis includes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to categorize customers based on their purchasing habits and identify high-value customers.
It also tracks the trend of Average Order Value (AOV) over time to assess sales performance. Additionally, the project includes visualizations to provide insights for strategic business decisions.

## Features

- Simulates customer, product, and order data
- Performs RFM Analysis to identify high-value customers
- Analyzes Average Order Value (AOV) trends over time
- Provides visual insights into customer behavior and spending patterns
